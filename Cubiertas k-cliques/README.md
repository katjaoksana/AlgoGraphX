The **CSV** files contain the incidences of a graph.
You can use these files as examples to run the programs by simply entering the CSV file name
at the end of the code where the function is called.

**Example**

_CliquesKGrafo("graph.csv", 2)_

_MatrizIncidencia("graph.csv")_

Some codes depend on others for their functionality. Below is a diagram explaining the dependency of each code.
