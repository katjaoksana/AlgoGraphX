The **CSV** files contain the incidences of a graph and the weight associated with the edge.
You can use these files as examples to run the programs by simply entering the CSV file name
at the end of the code where the function is called.
Additionally, you will need to provide a starting vertex according to its nomenclature.

**Example**

_Dijkstra("Graph.csv",5)_
