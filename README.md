## Description

This repository contains a collection of graph algorithms designed to solve various problems in complex networks. The included algorithms address community detection, shortest path search, and identification of k-clique covers. The goal of this repository is to provide efficient and easy-to-understand implementations of these algorithms for use in research, teaching, and practical applications.

## Repository Contents

- **Community Detection:** Algorithms that identify groups of nodes where the nodes within the group are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside the group.
- **Shortest Path Search:** Implementations of algorithms like Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- **k-Clique Cover Identification:** Algorithms to find subsets of nodes that form cliques of size k in the graph.
- **Test Data:** Datasets that can be used to test and validate the algorithms.

## Target Audience

This repository is intended for:

- **Researchers:** Working in the field of complex networks and graph theory.
- **Students:** Learning about graph algorithms and wanting to see practical implementations.
- **Developers:** Needing graph-based solutions for their projects and applications.
- **Teachers:** Looking for educational resources and examples to teach graph theory and related algorithms.
